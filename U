Mozilla Public License 1.0
(asnparser 2.10.10, asnparser 2.10.2~dfsg, libh323plus-dev 1.24.0~dfsg2, libopal-dbg 3.6.8, libpt-dev 2.10.4~dfsg, OPAL v3.10.1, ptlib 2.10.10, Saxon-B 9.1.0.8)

Mozilla Public License Version 1.0
==================================

1. Definitions.

  1.1. "Contributor" means each entity that creates or contributes to the
  creation of Modifications.

  1.2. "Contributor Version" means the combination of the Original Code, prior
  Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by that
  particular Contributor.

  1.3. "Covered Code" means the Original Code or Modifications or the combination
  of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case including portions
  thereof.

  1.4. "Electronic Distribution Mechanism" means a mechanism generally accepted
  in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data.

  1.5. "Executable" means Covered Code in any form other than Source Code.

  1.6. "Initial Developer" means the individual or entity identified as the
  Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

  1.7. "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof
  with code not governed by the terms of this License.

  1.8. "License" means this document.

  1.9. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the substance or
  structure of either the Original Code or any previous Modifications. When
  Covered Code is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

    A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing
    Original Code or previous Modifications.

    B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous
    Modifications.

  1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code which is
  described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as Original Code, and
  which, at the time of its release under this License is not already Covered
  Code governed by this License.

  1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for making
  modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated
  interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and
  installation of an Executable, or a list of source code differential
  comparisons against either the Original Code or another well known, available
  Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a
  compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or
  de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

  1.12. "You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and
  complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this
  License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity
  which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For
  purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect,
  to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
  shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Source Code License.

  2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
  The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

    (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
    the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as
    part of a Larger Work; and

    (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer,
    to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions
    thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably
    necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof)
    and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further
    Modifications or combinations.

  2.2. Contributor Grant.
  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

    (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute
    the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on
    an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of
    a Larger Work; and

    (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to
    Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the
    extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
    the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent
    that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License.
  The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by
  the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
  Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
  License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You
  must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
  distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version
  that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
  recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
  offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code.
  Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made
  available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
  same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
  made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for
  at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
  least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
  has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
  that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
  Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications.
  You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file
  documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
  any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is
  derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source
  Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
  in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims.
    If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
    particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
    must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL"
    which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
    that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
    after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
    shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available
    thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing
    lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
    Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs.
    If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
    control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you
    must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

  3.5. Required Notices.
  You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
  this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
  recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
  Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described
  in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
  Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location
  (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for
  such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
  Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
  of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear
  than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered
  by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
  You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
  Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
  notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available
  under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You
  have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
  included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
  collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered
  Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license
  of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
  that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
  for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
  rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
  You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make
  it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered
  by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
  to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
  terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works.
  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not
  governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a
  single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
  License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
  with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation
  then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
  possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
  description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and
  must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
  extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
  notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

  6.1. New Versions.
  Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new
  versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
  distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions.
  Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,
  You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
  choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of
  the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to
  modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

  6.3. Derivative Works.
  If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
  in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
  License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla",
  "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do
  not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your
  version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public
  License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
  Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A
  shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

  COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
  FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
  QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
  CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
  LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
  DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
  You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
  days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which
  are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
  which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
  License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
  CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
  PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
  computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
  (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with
  only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,
  the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all
  disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to
  intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
  arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any
  arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County,
  California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation
  relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
  Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara
  County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
  without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
  apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4,
  You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your
  utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of
  Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such
  rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
  distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

    Contributor.


3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
  contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
  limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
  License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
  with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
  any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
  version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
  include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
  Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
  You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
  this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
  accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
  Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
  Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
  it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
  version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
  recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
  remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained
  by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You
  contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
  Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
  that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
  provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
  Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
  version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership
  of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a
    third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
    granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must
    include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which
    describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that
    a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge
    after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
    Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor
    makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
    appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform
    those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application
    programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include
    this information in the LEGAL file. �

  ��������� (c)��� Representations.

    Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
    above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are
    Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
    to grant the rights conveyed by this License.


  3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
  of the Source Code.� If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
  Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
  location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
  for such a notice.� If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your
  name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.� You must also
  duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
  describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.� You
  may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
  may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
  liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
  Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
  that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
  version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
  including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
  Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
  Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
  choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
  are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
  the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You
  distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it
  absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
  You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
  indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
  terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
  other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
  Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
  of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
  with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order,
  or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
  maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
  affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
  Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
  Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
  be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.

5. Application of this License.

  This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
  notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

  6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may
  publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
  version will be given a distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
  particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
  terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
  terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
  other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
  Code created under this License.

  6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License
  (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
  Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so
  that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
  ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except
  to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
  clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
  Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
  Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
  Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
  License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
DISCLAIMER. 8. TERMINATION.

  8.1.� This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
  breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the
  Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this
  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
  termination of this License shall survive.

  8.2.� If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
  action is referred to as "Participant")� alleging that:

  (a)� such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under
  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
  Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of
  notice You either: (i)� agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
  agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made
  by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
  Contributor Version against such Participant.� If within 60 days of notice, a
  reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
  writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
  granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
  terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

  (b)� any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
  Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
  rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are
  revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or
  had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

  8.3.� If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
  that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
  any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
  prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
  value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2
  shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment
  or license.

  8.4.� In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,� all end
  user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall
  survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU. 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

  The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
  2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and
  ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48
  C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
  227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
  acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
  enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
  (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
  its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
  party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in
  the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
  subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
  California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
  party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
  reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations
  Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
  excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
  shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

  Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
  Multiple-Licensed.� Multiple-Licensedmeans that the Initial Developer permits
  you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the
  alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file
  described in Exhibit A.

      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b. 

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section�2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections�5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section�10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

DISCLAIMER
----------

Open Data Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal services of any
kind.

Open Data Commons has no formal relationship with you. Your receipt of this
document does not create any kind of agent-client relationship. Please seek the

Attribution License (ODC-By)
============================


PREAMBLE
--------

The Open Data Commons Attribution License is a license agreement intended to
allow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database subject only to the
attribution requirements set out in Section 4.

Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual
material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license
only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
individually. Licensors may therefore wish to use this license together with
another license for the contents.

Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by
other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over the
name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the
contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or
clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License.

The Licensor (as defined below)

and

You (as defined below)

agree as follows:


1.0 DEFINITIONS OF CAPITALISED WORDS
------------------------------------

"Collective Database" �� Means this Database in unmodified form as part of a
collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled
into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Database will not
be considered a Derivative Database.

"Convey" �� As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database, or the
Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables a Person to
make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative Database. Conveying does
not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and
Using a Produced Work, where no transfer of a copy of the Database or a
Derivative Database occurs.

"Contents" �� The contents of this Database, which includes the information,
independent works, or other material collected into the Database. For example,
the contents of the Database could be factual data or works such as images,
audiovisual material, text, or sounds.

"Database" �� A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a systematic or
methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered
under the terms of this License.

"Database Directive" �� Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or
succeeded.

"Database Right" �� Means rights resulting from the Chapter III ("sui generis")
rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed by member states),
which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial
part of the Contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant
jurisdiction under Section 10.4.

"Derivative Database" �� Means a database based upon the Database, and includes
any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration
of the Database or of a Substantial part of the Contents. This includes, but is
not limited to, Extracting or Re-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the
Contents in a new Database.

"Extraction" �� Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a Substantial
part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in any form.

"License" �� Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as
copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.

"Licensor" �� Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms of this
License.

"Person" �� Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or
incorporate.

"Produced Work" �� a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or
sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (via
a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative Database, or this
Database as part of a Collective Database.

"Publicly" �� means to Persons other than You or under Your control by either more
than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities (such as
contracting with an independent consultant).

"Re-utilisation" �� means any form of making available to the public all or a
Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by
online or other forms of transmission.

"Substantial" �� Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a
combination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of
insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the Extraction or
Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.

"Use" �� As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or
Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without
limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and
preparing derivative works of the Database, as well as modifying the Database as
may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.

"You" �� Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Database, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.

Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.


2.0 WHAT THIS LICENSE COVERS
----------------------------

2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:

a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;

b. A license of the Database Right; and

c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.

2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the Database,
including:

a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database. The copyright
licensed includes any individual elements of the Database, but does not cover the
copyright over the Contents independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for
details. Copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the
Database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation
of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table indexes; the
data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of Contents stored in the
Database;

b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and
Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents. Database
Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the Database. Database
Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed from the Database and are
selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright;
and

c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for access to the
Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as
outlined in this License.

2.3 Rights not covered.

a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making or
operation of the Database;

b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the Database; and

c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the Database.

2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of the
Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights, including
copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this
License does not cover any rights (other than Database Rights or in contract) in
individual Contents contained in the Database.

For example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this License would
not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own
separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the
images.


3.0 RIGHTS GRANTED
------------------

3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants to
You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but only under Section
9) license to Use the Database for the duration of any applicable copyright and
Database Rights. These rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not
exclude any field of endeavour. To the extent possible in the relevant
jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or created in the future.

The rights granted cover, for example:

a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the
Contents;

b. Creation of Derivative Databases;

c. Creation of Collective Databases;

d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form,
in whole or in part, including of any Derivative Databases or as a part of
Collective Databases; and

e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or
performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part,
including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective Databases.

3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:

a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be
waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,

c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a
collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that
society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop
distributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that this
Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice of using
alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section 10.4, all other rights
not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.


4.0 CONDITIONS OF USE
---------------------

4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to Your
complying with the following conditions of use. These are important conditions of
this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be in material breach of
its terms.

4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative Database, or
the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You must:

a. Do so only under the terms of this License;

b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) with
the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the Database or Derivative
Database and in any relevant documentation;

c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to
this License; and

d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to
its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a
relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.

4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced Work does
not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you Publicly Use a Produced
Work, You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably
calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is
otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the
Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database,
and that it is available under this License.

a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:

  Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available under the ODC
  Attribution License.

DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a hyperlink to
the location of the Database. "ODC Attribution License" should contain a
hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If hyperlinks are not possible,
You should include the plain text of the required URI's with the above notice.

4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time You
communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the Contents, or any
Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the Database on the same terms and conditions as this
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License, but You may enforce any rights that You have over a Derivative
Database. You are solely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative
Database made by You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
License.


5.0 MORAL RIGHTS
----------------

5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights to be
identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment that would
otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or any other derogatory
treatment:

a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives all moral
rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest extent possible by
the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4;

b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is
not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the Database
and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law
of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4; and

c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral
rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over
certain aspects of the Database.

Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights,
and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some jurisdictions.


6.0 FAIR DEALING, DATABASE EXCEPTIONS, AND OTHER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED
--------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may
independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this Database,
including without limitation:

a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from
non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for purposes of
illustration for teaching or scientific research, and Extraction or
Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.

b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation or
exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws.

6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract and
Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated quantitatively or
qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a Derivative
Database (subject to other rights over the Contents, see Section 2.4). The
repeated and systematic Extraction or Re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of
the Contents may however amount to the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a
Substantial part of the Contents.


7.0 WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER
-----------------------------

7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of
any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of
dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied
warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, accuracy or completeness,
the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose,
merchantability, or otherwise. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.


8.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
---------------------------

8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the
Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or
damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this License,
whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of
the Licensor or not. This exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to,
any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as
loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion
applies even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct
financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the
Licensor.


9.0 TERMINATION OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------

9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License automatically
terminates this License with immediate effect and without notice to You. For the
avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the Database, the whole or a
Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative Databases, or the Database as part
of a Collective Database from You under this License will not have their licenses
terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this License or a
license granted under Section 4.8 of this License. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10
will survive any termination of this License.

9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor will not
terminate Your rights under it.

9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You for the
duration of applicable rights in the Database.

9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and conditions
of this License, then your full rights under this License will be reinstated:

a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after
cessation of breach;

b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise
reasonably notified by the Licensor; or

c. Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the violation, this is
the first time You have received notice of violation of this License from the
Licensor, and You cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making
available the Database. Releasing the Database under different license terms or
stopping the distribution of the Database will not withdraw this License (or any
other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of
this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
terminated as stated above.


10.0 GENERAL
------------

10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms
and conditions of this License and each remaining provision of this License shall
be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any earlier understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Database.

10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be entitled
to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any breach by the
Licensor.

10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by the laws
of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
and Database Rights in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not
granted under this License, these additional rights are granted in this License
in order to meet the terms of this License.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
=====================

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007


PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any
software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The
fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.


DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s)
under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files,
build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
substituting �� in part or in whole �� any of the components of the Original
Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other
person who contributed to the Font Software.


PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and
sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or
Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the
above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s)
unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright
Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to
the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software
shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except
to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s)
or with their explicit written permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any
other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not
apply to any document created using the Font Software.


TERMINATION

This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

==========================================

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the
following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only
where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as
provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."

Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission
to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable,
regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and
distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you
also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived
from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this
exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If
you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

Version 2, June 1991
--------------------

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b.  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
        or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
        to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
        terms of this License.

      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
    object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
    cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.

  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.
